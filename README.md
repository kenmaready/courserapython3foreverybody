Scripts and other information are slightly modified from materials provided by Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck) of the University of Michigan through the Python for Everyone Specialization via Coursera.  These are provided as they were originally created and/or provided by Dr. Chuck with small modifications to enable the scripts to run on Python 3.x.  These do not include modifications made as part of a project or assignment as part of the learning experience - only the python3 modifications.

I am just learning to program, so the changes I made may not be the most optimal or the most obvious choices to someone with more experience.  I just provide what enabled the scripts to work for me on python 3.
